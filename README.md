# AI Storybook Generator

This project implements an AI Agent assistant using GPTScript, capable of chaining AI tasks together to create a complete Storybook with beautiful text and images, all generated from a single initial prompt. The project also showcases real-time processing, story storage, and more, leveraging the power of Next.js and OpenAI.
